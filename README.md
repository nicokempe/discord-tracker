### üöÄ Introduction
Welcome to the Discord Activity Tracker Bot repository. This bot monitors configured users and broadcasts their Discord activities to specified channels. It includes optional Spotify track details and rotates through predefined status messages.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Features
* **Activity Tracking**: Tracks what users are playing, listening to, or watching in real-time.
* **Spotify Integration**: Displays details about songs being played on Spotify.
* **Rotating Status Messages**: Cycles through a predefined list of statuses every hour.
* **Dynamic User Management**: Supports user configuration via users.json for flexible activity tracking across multiple users.
* **Docker Support**: Easy to deploy and manage using Docker.

### üíª Technologies

This bot is developed using:
* [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for simplified deployment


### üê≥ Installation and Setup

To set up the Discord Activity Tracker Bot, follow these instructions:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   Clone the repository to your machine or server.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nicokempe/discord-tracker.git
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:

- Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env`.
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

- Edit the `.env` file and replace the placeholder value with your actual Discord bot token.
  ```env
  DISCORD_TOKEN=your_actual_discord_bot_token
  ```
  
3. **Configure User Tracking**: The bot allows tracking multiple users dynamically through a users.json file. This file specifies which users the bot should track and in which channels to post updates.

   Create a `config` directory in the project root and add your own `users.json` file. This file is not included in the repository and must be supplied by you.

   Example `users.json`:

    ```json
    {
      "users": [
        {
          "userId": "1234567890",
          "channelId": "9876543210",
          "broadcast": false,
          "prefix": ":boom:",
          "mentionUser": true
        },
        {
          "userId": "0987654321",
          "channelId": "5678901234",
          "broadcast": true,
          "prefix": ":star:",
          "mentionUser": false
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    The `broadcast` flag controls how updates are phrased. When set to `true`, updates are formatted for a public channel with the user's name. If `false`, messages address the user directly.

4. **Docker Setup**: Make sure Docker is installed on your system. Use the `Dockerfile` to build and run the bot with Docker.

    **Build and run with Docker**:

    ```bash
    docker build -t discord-tracker .
    docker run -d --name discord-tracker -v $(pwd)/config:/usr/src/app/config discord-tracker
    ```
   
    -   The `users.json` should be placed inside the `config` folder in your project root, and Docker will mount this directory at runtime.

5. **Start the Bot**: After setting everything up, start the bot. It will automatically begin tracking the specified users and post updates to the designated channels.

### üöÄ Usage

After setting up, the bot will automatically start tracking the users specified in `users.json` and rotate its status. It will also post updates about their activities in the designated Discord channels. Ensure the bot has the necessary permissions in your Discord server to function properly.
