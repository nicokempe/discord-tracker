* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for simplified deployment


### üê≥ Installation and Setup

To set up the Discord Activity Tracker Bot, follow these instructions:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   Clone the repository to your machine or server.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nicokempe/discord-tracker.git
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:

- Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env`.
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

- Edit the `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual Discord bot token, user ID, and the channel ID where messages will be posted.
  ```env
  DISCORD_TOKEN=your_actual_discord_bot_token
  ```
  
3. **Configure User Tracking**: The bot allows tracking multiple users dynamically through a users.json file. This file specifies which users the bot should track and in which channels to post updates.

   Example `users.json`:

    ```json
    {
      "users": [
        {
          "userId": "1234567890",
          "channelId": "9876543210",
          "isFanClub": false,
          "prefix": ":boom:",
          "mentionUser": true
        },
        {
          "userId": "0987654321",
          "channelId": "5678901234",
          "isFanClub": true,
          "prefix": ":star:",
          "mentionUser": false
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

4. **Docker Setup**: Make sure Docker is installed on your system. Use the `Dockerfile` to build and run the bot with Docker.

    **Build and run with Docker**:

    ```bash
    docker build -t discord-tracker .
    docker run -d --name discord-tracker -v $(pwd)/config:/usr/src/app/config discord-tracker
    ```
   
    -   The `users.json` should be placed inside the `config` folder in your project root, and Docker will mount this directory at runtime.

5. **Start the Bot**: After setting everything up, start the bot. It will automatically begin tracking the specified users and post updates to the designated channels.

### üöÄ Usage

After setting up, the bot will automatically start tracking your Discord activities and update its status. It will also post updates about your activities in the designated Discord channel. Ensure the bot has the necessary permissions in your Discord server to function properly.
